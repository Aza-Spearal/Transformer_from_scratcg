# Transformer_from_scratch

Project completed ! This is a transformer from scratch that I made for skill-building and I use it to create an English-French translator.

The architecture is taken from the original Transformer paper.
The original paper: Vaswani, Ashish, et al. "Attention is all you need." Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017).
